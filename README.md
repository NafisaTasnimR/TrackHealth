# TrackHealth
TrackHealth is a console-based Java application that helps users set and achieve their fitness goals through personalized diet and workout plans, progress tracking, and motivational features.

Maintaining fitness can sometimes feel monotonous—following strict routines, sticking to rules(many of which you might not even like), and doing the same thing every day. But when progress becomes visible and goals feel within reach, the journey becomes more exciting and rewarding. That's where TrackHealth comes in — making your fitness journey feel more rewarding by helping you track, plan, and stay motivated.

## Features
### Goal Setting
Users can select a fitness goal — Weight Gain, Weight Loss, or Maintenance.
They provide essential details like current weight, target weight, height, goal duration, country, and workout location to begin their journey.

### Personalized Plans
Based on the selected goal, the application generates customized workout routines and meal plans using dedicated services. 
These are tailored to support the user’s fitness objective effectively.

### Progress Tracking
Users can log their current weight over time.
The application calculates BMI and progress percentage
Weight logs are saved using the file system
Users can visually track how close they are to reaching their goals
Logging is limited to once per day to ensure meaningful tracking.

### Health Insights
Users receive insights like:

- BMI Calculation
- Calorie Needs
These help users better understand their fitness profile and make informed decisions throughout their journey.

### Motivation & Rewards
The application shows timely reminders to log weight and stay on track. 
Users who consistently track their progress receive weekly health tips and are rewarded with a congratulatory message upon achieving their goals. 
It will also motivate you to stay positive even if you were not able to reach your goal.
